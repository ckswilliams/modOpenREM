   Figure 1: The ``Config`` menu (user and admin)

The home page can be configured to show the number of studies carried out in
the past 7 and 28 days for each system. These default values can be changed by
logging in, clicking on the ``Config`` menu at the right-hand end of the
navigation bar, and then selecting the ``Home page options`` entry under the
``User level config`` items shown in the upper section of figure 1. This takes
the user to a page where the values can be viewed and updated (figure 2).

By default the display of workload information is disabled. This setting can be
changed by an OpenREM administrator via the ``Home page options`` entry under
the ``System level settings`` config menu (lower portion of figure 1). This
brings up a simple form where the current settings can viewed and modified.
