Changes since 0.7.0
===================

Extremely minor change to the documenation links

***************************************************
Upgrading an OpenREM server with no internet access
***************************************************

Follow the instructions found at :doc:`upgrade-offline`, before returning here to update the database and configuration.

..  _upgradefrom060:

****************************
Upgrading from version 0.6.0
****************************

* Back up your database

    * For PostgreSQL you can refer to :ref:`backup-psql-db`
    * For a non-production SQLite3 database, simply make a copy of the database file

* Stop any Celery workers

* The 0.7.0 upgrade must be made from a 0.6.0 (or later) database, and a schema migration is required:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    pip install openrem==0.7.1

In a shell/command window, move into the openrem folder:

* Ubuntu linux: ``/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/openrem/``
* Other linux: ``/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/openrem/``
* Linux virtualenv: ``lib/python2.7/site-packages/openrem/``
* Windows: ``C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\openrem\``
* Windows virtualenv: ``Lib\site-packages\openrem\``

Delete all numbered migration files in openrem's ``remapp/migrations`` folder, **leaving the 0002 files ending in .inactive**

* If there is no file named ``__init__.py`` in the ``remapp/migrations`` folder, please create it.
* If you have accidentally deleted the 0002 files ending in ``.inactive``, you can get a new copy from
  `the bitbucket repository <https://bitbucket.org/openrem/openrem/src/008ec3c2e7ffee89355c10fda39a6293b79fa89f/stuff/0002_upgrade_0_7_from_0_6.py.inactive?at=develop>`_.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
    python manage.py makemigrations remapp
    python manage.py migrate remapp --fake

Now rename the file

.. sourcecode:: console

    remapp/migrations/0002_upgrade_0_7_from_0_6.py.inactive

to:

.. sourcecode:: console

    remapp/migrations/0002_upgrade_0_7_from_0_6.py

and then run

.. sourcecode:: console

    python manage.py migrate remapp

.. note::

    With a large database, this may take some time!

* Review the new ``openremproject/local_settings.py.example`` file and copy accross the logging section. Then see
  :ref:`local_settings_logfile` settings in the install docs.

  If you are using PuTTY on Windows to interact with a linux server, you can select the logging configuration section
  of the example file with your mouse, and it will be automatically copied to the clipboard. Then open the existing
  ``local_settings.py`` file with nano, move the curser down to the bottom and click the right mouse button to paste.

Restart all the services!
=========================

Some of the commands and services have changed - follow the guide at :doc:`startservices`.
