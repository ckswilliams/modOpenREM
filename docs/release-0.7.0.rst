****************************
Upgrading from version 0.6.0
****************************

* Back up your database

    * For PostgreSQL you can refer to :doc:`backupRestorePostgreSQL`
    * For a non-production SQLite3 database, simply make a copy of the database file

* The 0.7.0 upgrade must be made from a 0.6.0 (or later) database, and a schema migration is required:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    pip install openrem==0.7.0b7

In a shell/command window, move into the openrem folder:

* Ubuntu linux: ``/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/openrem/``
* Other linux: ``/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/openrem/``
* Linux virtualenv: ``lib/python2.7/site-packages/openrem/``
* Windows: ``C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\openrem\``
* Windows virtualenv: ``Lib\site-packages\openrem``

Delete all numbered migration files in openrem's ``migrations`` folder.

If there is no file named ``__init__.py`` in the ``migrations`` folder, please create it. It should be empty. In Windows,
you might create a text file called ``__init__.txt``, then change the file suffix from ``.txt`` to ``.py``, and accept
the warning about files becoming unusable. In linux, ``touch remapp/migrations/__init__.py`` will do the job.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
    python manage.py makemigrations remapp
    python manage.py migrate remapp --fake

* Now rename the file::

    0002_openrem_upgrade_add_new_tables_and_populate_and_add_median_function.py.inactive

  to::

    0002_openrem_upgrade_add_new_tables_and_populate_and_add_median_function.py

  and then run::

    python manage.py migrate remapp

Daemonising Celery
------------------

In a production environment, Celery will need to start automatically and
not depend on a particular user being logged in. Therefore, much like
the webserver, it will need to be daemonised. For now, please refer to the
instructions and links at http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/daemonizing.html.
