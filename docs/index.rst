OpenREM is an opensource framework created for the purpose of radiation 
exposure monitoring. The software is capable of importing and displaying 
data from a wide variety of x-ray dose related sources, and then enables 
easy export of the data in a form that is suitable for further analysis 
by suitably qualified medical physics personnel.

Please see `openrem.org <http://openrem.org>`_ for more details.

..  Note::
    OpenREM does not currently include a DICOM Store SCP, ie you will
    need to install a DICOM store server in order to send RSDRs or other
    DICOM files from modalities.
    
    If you have no preference, `Conquest <http://ingenium.home.xs4all.nl/dicom.html>`_
    is recommended as a free, open source, scriptable DICOM server. Please
    note though that you will need to include the RSRD SOP in the dgatesop.lst
    file.
