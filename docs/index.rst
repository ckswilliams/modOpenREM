OpenREM is an opensource framework created for the purpose of radiation 
exposure monitoring. The software is capable of importing and displaying 
data from a wide variety of x-ray dose related sources, and then enables 
easy export of the data in a form that is suitable for further analysis 
by suitably qualified medical physics personnel.

Please see `openrem.org <http://openrem.org>`_ for more details.
