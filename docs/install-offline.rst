*******************************
Offline Installation on Windows
*******************************

In order to carry out an offline installation you will need to download the OpenREM package and dependencies.
The instructions below should work for downloading on any operating system, as long as you have Python 2.7 and a
reasonably up to date version of pip installed.

If you have trouble when installing the Python packages due to incorrect architecture, you may need to either download
on a Windows system similar to the server (matching 32-bit/64-bit), or to download the files from
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ instead.

On a computer with internet access
==================================

Download independent binaries
-----------------------------

**Python** from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

* Follow the link to the 'Latest Python 2 release'
* Download either the ``Windows x86 MSI installer`` for 32-bit Windows or
* Download ``Windows x86-64 MSI installer`` for 64-bit Windows

**Erlang** from https://www.erlang.org/downloads

* Download the latest version of Erlang/OTP. Again, choose between
* ``Windows 32-bit Binary File`` or
* ``Windows 64-bit Binary File``

**RabbitMQ** from http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html

* Download ``rabbitmq-server-x.x.x.exe`` from either option

**PostgreSQL** from http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#windows

*Note: Other databases such as MySQL are also suitable, though the median function for charts will not be available. For
testing purposes only, you could skip this step and use SQLite3 which comes with OpenREM*

* Download by clicking on the icon for ``Win x86-32`` or ``Win x86-64``

**A webserver** although this can be left till later - you can get started with the built-in web
server

Download python packages from PyPI
----------------------------------

In a console, navigate to a suitable place and create an empty directory to collect all the packages in, then use pip to
download them all:

.. code-block:: console

    mkdir openremfiles
    pip download -d openremfiles celery==3.1.25  # this line not required for Linux
    pip download -d openremfiles openrem
    pip download -d openremfiles psycopg2-binary
    pip download --no-deps -d openremfiles https://bitbucket.org/edmcdonagh/pynetdicom/get/default.tar.gz#egg=pynetdicom-0.8.2b2

.. note::

    Older versions of pip may need to use the following command instead:

    ``pip install -d openremfiles openrem``

    * Note: this  of ``pynetdicom`` is modified in comparison to the version in PyPI, and will malfunction if you use
      the official version

Copy everything to the Windows machine
--------------------------------------

* Copy this directory plus all the binaries to the Windows server that you are using


On the Windows server without internet access
=============================================

Installation of binaries
------------------------

Install the binaries in the following order:

1. Python
2. Erlang
3. RabbitMQ

Installation of the python packages
-----------------------------------

In a console, navigate to the directory that your ``openremfiles`` directory is in, and

.. sourcecode:: python

    pip install --no-index --find-links=openremfiles celery==3.1.25  # this link not required for Linux
    pip install --no-index --find-links=openremfiles openrem  # where openremfiles is the directory you created
    pip install --no-index --find-links=openremfiles psycopg2-binary

    pip install openremfiles\default.tar.gz  # this is the custom version of pynetdicom

Install PostgreSQL
------------------

See the instructions to :ref:`windowspsqlinstall` on Windows.

Install webserver
-----------------

If you are doing so at this stage.

Configure OpenREM ready for use
===============================

OpenREM is now installed, so go straight to the :ref:`localsettingsconfig` section of the standard installation docs
