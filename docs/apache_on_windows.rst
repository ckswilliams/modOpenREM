Installing Apache for OpenREM on Windows Server 2012
****************************************************

..  Note:: Author JA Cole

These instructions are for installing OpenREM under Apache on Windows as 
a developers alternative to the built-in HTTP server. They have been written 
using Windows Server 2012, and feature automatic restarts of the Apache server
when the code changes, much as the built-in server does.

Get and Install Apache
======================
    
+ Download the zip of the appropriate version from https://www.apachelounge.com/
+ Extract the zip somewhere useful. For this guide we will assume ``C:\apache24\``

Get and Install MOD_WSGI
========================

+ Download mod_wsgi that matches your Windows, Apache and Python versions from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#mod_wsgi
+ Extract the mod_wsgi.so file to ``C:\apache24\modules\``
+ Add the following module  ``C:\apache24\conf\httpd.conf``::

	LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so
	
+ At the end of ``C:\apache24\conf\httpd.conf`` add the following::

	WSGIScriptAlias / "c:/Python27/Lib/site-packages/openrem/openrem/wsgi.py"
	WSGIPythonPath "c:/Python27/Lib/site-packages/openrem"

	<Directory "c:/Python27/Lib/site-packages/openrem/openrem">
	<Files wsgi.py>
	Order deny,allow
	Require all granted
	</Files>cd c:\py	
	</Directory>


Get and Install wsgi.py and monitor.py
======================================

Detailed instructions are available here: https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ReloadingSourceCode

+ Change wsgi.py in the openrem/openrem folder to the following

.. code-block:: python

	"""
	WSGI config for OpenREM project.

	This module contains the WSGI application used by Django's development server
	and any production WSGI deployments. It should expose a module-level variable
	named ``application``. Django's ``runserver`` and ``runfcgi`` commands discover
	this application via the ``WSGI_APPLICATION`` setting.

	Usually you will have the standard Django WSGI application here, but it also
	might make sense to replace the whole Django WSGI application with a custom one
	that later delegates to the Django one. For example, you could introduce WSGI
	middleware here, or combine a Django application with an application of another
	framework.

	import os
	import sys

	path = 'C:/Python27/Lib/site-packages/openrem'
	if path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(path)

	os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "openrem.settings")

	# Apply WSGI middleware here.

	import django.core.handlers.wsgi
	application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()

	import openrem.monitor
	openrem.monitor.start(interval=1.0)
	
+ Create a file monitor.py in the openrem/openrem folder with the following contents

Install Micosoft C++ Distributable
==================================

Install the microsoft C++ distributable making sure the version number matches the version number for the apache and mod_wsgi downloads.
`<http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679#>`_



Optional: Install apache as a service
=====================================
Run a terminal as administrator.::

    c:\apache24\bin\httpd -k install


Setup the URLs
==============

Add the following to the openrem urls.py file::

	from django.conf import settings
	if settings.DEBUG:
	    urlpatterns += patterns('django.contrib.staticfiles.views',
	        url(r'^static/(?P<path>.*)$', 'serve'),
	    )

Collect the static files
========================

Collect your static files by running::

	python manage.py collectstatic

If this fails because openrem lacks a static folder either copy the static folder from remapp to the openrem directory, adjust the openrem settings or set up a link.
To setup a link run::

	mklink /D c:\python27\lib\site-packages\openrem\static c:\python27\lib\site-packages\openrem\remapp\static
