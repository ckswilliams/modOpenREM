Importing data to OpenREM
*************************

Importing dose related data from DICOM files
============================================

If you are using linux, or for Windows if you have put
``C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages;C:\Python27\Scripts`` onto
your system path, you should be able to import from the command line:

Radiation Dose Structured Reports
---------------------------------

.. sourcecode:: bash

    openrem_rdsr.py filename.dcm

You can use wildcards to process a number of files at once, ie::

    openrem_rdsr.py *.dcm


For mammography DICOM images
----------------------------
.. sourcecode:: bash

    openrem_mg.py filename.dcm

The facility for extracting dose information from mammography DICOM images
has been designed and tested with images created with the GE Senographe DS.
It has now also been used with the images generated by the
following systems:

    * GE Senographe Essential
    * Hologic Selenia
    * Siemens Inspiration

For radiographic DICOM images
-----------------------------
.. sourcecode:: bash

    openrem_dx.py filename.dcm


For CT dose summary files from Philips CT scanners
--------------------------------------------------
.. sourcecode:: bash

    openrem_ctphilips.py filename.dcm


Importing dose related data from csv files using the command line
=================================================================

Patient height and weight information
-------------------------------------

If height and weight data is not available in the DICOM data, but is available
from another source, then it can be imported into the database using the 
``openrem_ptsizecsv.py`` function. Normally the key to match the size information
with the studies in the database will be the accession number; however in some
situations this isn't available and the Study Instance UID can be used instead.

usage::

    openrem_ptsizecsv.py [-h] [-u] [-v] csvfile id height weight

``-h, --help``
  Print the help text.

``-u, --si-uid``
  Use Study Instance UID instead of Accession Number.

``-v, --verbose``
  *New in 0.3.7* Print to the standard output the success or otherwise of inserting each value.

``csvfile``
  csv file containing the height and/or weight information and study identifier. 
  Other columns will be ignored. Use quotes if the filepath has spaces.

``id``
  Column title for the accession number or study instance UID. Use quotes
  if the title has spaces.

``height``
  Column title for the patient height (DICOM size) - if this information 
  is missing simply add a blank column with a suitable title. Use quotes
  if the title has spaces.

``weight``
  Column title for the patient weight - if this information is missing 
  simply add a blank column with a suitable title. Use quotes if the title
  has spaces.

..  versionchanged:: 0.3.7
    Verbosity flag added to supress printing to the standard output
    unless requested.
