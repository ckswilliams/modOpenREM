Importing data to OpenREM
*************************

Importing dose related data from DICOM files
============================================

If you are using linux, or for Windows if you have put
``C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages;C:\Python27\Scripts`` onto
your system path, you should be able to import from the command line:

Radiation Dose Structured Reports
---------------------------------

.. sourcecode:: bash

    openrem_rdsr.py filename.dcm

You can use wildcards to process a number of files at once, ie::

    openrem_rdsr.py *.dcm


For mammography DICOM images
----------------------------
.. sourcecode:: bash

    openrem_mg.py filename.dcm

The facility for extracting dose information from mammography DICOM images
has been designed and tested with images created with the GE Senographe DS.
It has now also been used with the images generated by the
following systems:

    * GE Senographe Essential
    * Hologic Selenia
    * Siemens Inspiration

For radiographic DICOM images
-----------------------------
.. sourcecode:: bash

    openrem_dx.py filename.dcm


For CT dose summary files from Philips CT scanners
--------------------------------------------------
.. sourcecode:: bash

    openrem_ctphilips.py filename.dcm
