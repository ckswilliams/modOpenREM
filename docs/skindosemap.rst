Calculation and display of skin dose maps
#########################################

************************************
Functionality that is available
************************************

* Skin dose map data is calculated to the surface of a simple geometric phantom
  using the in-built `openSkin`_ routines (3D phantom)
* The calculated doses include kVp-dependent backscatter factors, and account
  for any copper filters; aluminium or other filters are not considered
* The phantom dimensions are calculated from the height and mass of the
  patient; defaults of 1.786 m and 73.2 kg are used when patient height and mass
  are not available
* Data can be calculated on import to OpenREM, or on demand when a study is
  viewed
* Data is recalculated automatically if the patient height or mass stored in
  the database differs from the values stored in the skin dose map data file.
  This is useful when patient size information has been imported in to OpenREM
  after the initial skin dose map data has been calculated
* 3D skin dose map data is shown graphically as a 2D image and a 3D model
* The 3D model can be manipulated using a touch screen 
* The user can change the maximum and minimum displayed dose; alternatively,
  window level and width can be adjusted
* A colour dose scale is shown with a selection of colour schemes
* The skin dose map section can be displayed full-screen
* The calculated peak skin dose, phantom dimensions, patient height, mass and
  orientation used for the calculations are shown in the top left hand corner
  of the skin dose map
* If skin dose map display is disabled then fluoroscopy study data can be
  exported in a format suitable for the stand-alone openSkin routines

The phantom consists of a cuboid with one semi-cylinder on each side (see
3D phantom section of `phantom design`_ on the openSkin website for details).

2D visualisation of the 3D data

   Figure 1: 2D visualisation of the 3D data

This is a 2D view of the whole surface of the 3D phantom, as though the phantom
surface has been peeled off and laid out flat (figure 1). The 2D visualisation
includes the following features:

* The skin dose at the mouse pointer is shown as a tool-tip
* Moving the mouse whilst holding down the left-hand mouse button changes the
  window level and width of the displayed skin dose map
* An overlay indicating the phantom regions and orientation can be toggled on
  and off. This indicates the phantom anterior, left, posterior and right
  sides, and also shows the superior and inferior ends (figure 2)
* The current view can be saved as a png file

   Figure 3: 3D visualisation of the data

This is a 3D view of the phantom that was used for the calculations, with the
skin dose map overlaid onto the surface. The 3D visualisation includes the
following features:

* Moving the mouse whilst holding down the left-hand mouse button rotates the
  3D model
* Using the mouse wheel zooms in and out
* A simple 3D model of a person is displayed in the bottom left corner. This is
  to enable the viewer to orientate themselves when viewing the 3D skin dose
  map
* The current view can be saved as a png file

**********************
Skin dose map settings
**********************

There are two skin dose map options that can be set by an OpenREM
administrator via the ``Skin dose map settings`` option in the ``Config menu``:

* Enable skin dose maps
* Calculate skin dose maps on import

The first of these sets whether skin dose map data is calculated, and also
switches the display of skin dose maps on or off. The second option controls
whether the skin dose map data is calculated at the point when a new study is
imported into OpenREM, or calculated when a user first views the details of
that particular study in the OpenREM interface.

When skin dose maps are enabled:

* When a user views the details of a fluoroscopy study OpenREM looks for a skin
  dose map pickle file on the OpenREM server in the ``skin_maps`` subfolder of
  ``MEDIA_ROOT`` that corresponds to the study being viewed. If found, the skin
  dose map data in the pickle file is loaded and displayed. The ``skin_maps``
  folder is created if it does not exist
* If a pickle file is not found then OpenREM calculates skin dose map data.
  These calculations can take some time. They are carried out in the
  background: an animated graphic is shown during the calculations. On
  successful calculation of the data the skin dose map is displayed. A pickle
  file containing the data is saved in the server's ``skin_maps`` subfolder of
  ``MEDIA_ROOT``. The file name is of the form ``skin_map_XXXX.p``, where
  ``XXXX`` is the database primary key of the study
* For subsequent views of the same study the data in the pickle file is loaded,
  rather than re-calculating the data, making the display of the skin dose map
  much quicker

When calculation on import is enabled:

* OpenREM calculates the skin dose map data for a fluoroscopy study as soon as
  it arrives in the system
* A pickle file containing the data is saved in the ``skin_maps`` subfolder of
  ``MEDIA_ROOT``
* Users viewing the details of a study won't have to wait for the skin dose map
  data to be calculated


**************************
Exporting data to openSkin
**************************

If skin dose maps are disabled, and the user has export rights, the user is
presented with the option of exporting the study data as a csv file that is
formatted for use with a stand-alone installation of openSkin. The user must
be in the detail view of the study they wish to create the exposure incidence
map for, and then click on the link to create the OpenSkin export (figure 5).

Instructions for openSkin
*************************

Download the openSkin repository as a zip file from `openSkin downloads`_. To
use openSkin as a stand-alone application you need python 2.x and the pypng
python library.

* Extract the contents of the zip file into a folder on your computer and run
  `python main.py` from a command line and answer each question.
* See `phantom design`_ for details of the 2D and 3D phantoms.
* When asked for the source csv file use the one exported from OpenREM
* Depending on the number of events in the export and the power of your
  computer the calculations can take a few minutes

Two files will be produced - a textfile called ``skin_dose_results.txt`` and a
small image called ``skin_dose_map.png``

Results text file
=================

It should look something like this::

    File created    : 04/21/15 17:42:45
    Data file       : C:/Users/[...]/exports-2015-04-21-OpenSkinExport20150421-162805246134.csv
    Phantom         : 90.0x70.0 3d phantom
    Peak dose (Gy)  :                  0.50844405521
    Cells > 3 Gy    :                              0
    Cells > 5 Gy    :                              0
    Cells > 10 Gy   :                              0

The peak dose is the peak incident dose delivered to any one-cm-square area. If
any of these 1 cm\ :sup:`2` areas (referred to as cells) are above 3 Gy, then
the number of cells in this category, or the two higher dose categories, are
listed in the table accordingly.

Incidence map image file
========================

The image file will be a small 70x90 px PNG image if you used the 3D phantom,
or 150 x 50 px PNG if you used the 2D phantom. With both, the head end of the
table is on the left.

The image is scaled so that black is 0 Gy and white is 10 Gy. For most studies,
this results in an incidence map that is largely black. However, if you use
`GIMP`_ or `ImageJ`_ or similar to increase the contrast, you will find that
the required map is there.

A native and 'colour equalised' version of the same export are shown below:

Limitations
***********

Skin dose map calculations do not currently work for all systems. Siemens Artis
Zee data is known to work. If skin dose maps do not work for your systems then
please let us know via the `OpenREM Google Group`_.

`openSkin`_ is yet to be validated independently - if this is something you
want to do, please do go ahead and feed back your findings to Jonathan Cole at
`jacole`_.
